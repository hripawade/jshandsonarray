    Find the Product.
    Write a program that takes an array as input from the user and find out the product of the elements.
    
    Note: You have to complete Find_Prod. No need to take any input.
    <pre>const Find_Prod = (array, N) => 
        {
         const result=array.reduce((accu,cur)=>
         accu = accu*cur,1)
        
         
        return result;
        };
        </pre>
        Find the Sum.
        Write a program which takes an array as input from the user and find out the sum of the array elements.
        
        Note: You have to complete Find_Sum. No need to take any input.
        <pre>const Find_Sum = (array, N) => 
            {
               const result=array.reduce((accu,cur)=>
             accu = accu+cur,0)

        Count Occurrences
        You are given an array 
        A
         containing 
        N
         integer elements and an integer 
        K
        , and your task is to return the count of occurrences of 
        K
         in array 
        A
        .
        
        Note: You have to complete findCount function. No need to take any input.
        <pre>const findCount = (N, K, Arr) => 
            {
              let count=0;
              for(let i = 0;i<N;i++){
                if(Arr[i]==K){
                  count=count+1;
                }
              }

            };
             </pre>  
             Even Odd
You are given an array 
A
 containing 
N
 integer elements, and your task is to return an array 
B
 
(
having a size equal to 
2
)
, where 
B
[
0
]
 contains the sum of all even elements of array A and 
B
[
1
]
 has the sum of all odd elements of the array 
A
.
<pre>const findEvenOdd = (N, Arr) => 
    {
      let B=[];
      var a=Arr.filter((x)=>x%2===0)
      var b=a.reduce((accu,cum)=>accu=accu+cum,0)
      B.push(b);
      
      var c=Arr.filter((x)=>x%2!==0)
      var d=c.reduce((accu,cum)=>accu=accu+cum,0)
      B.push(d);
      return B;
    };

     <pre>Find whether the number is present or not
        Write a program which takes an array as input from the user and a number.
        Check whether the number is present or not.
        const Find_Num = (array,N,M) => 
        {
          let flag=0;
          for(i=0;i<N;i++){
            if(array[i]===M)
              flag++;
            }
            if(flag>0){
              return "YES";

        Higher Age
        You are given an array 
        A
         containing the age of persons in your locality, and your task is to find and return an array containing the age of persons that are over 
        18
         
        (
        18
         included
        )
        .
        const highAge = (N, Arr) => 
        {
            const result = Arr.filter((N)=>N>=18)
            return result;
        };
        Increment the Array Elements
        You are provided an array of integers and you have to increment all array elements by 1 and then print whole array.
        const Inc_Arr = (array,N) => 
        {
          
        const result =array.map((N)=>N+1);
        console.log(...result);
        };
        Pass or Fail
        You are given an array 
        A
         containing the maths marks of students in your class, and your task is to determine if all the students pass in your class or not. A student is declared pass if his maths marks are greater than or equal to 
        32
        .
        
        If all the students pass in your class, return "YES" (without quotes); otherwise, return "NO" (without quotes).
        const isAllPass = (N, Arr) => 
        {
           if(Arr.every((N)=> N>= 32)){
             return "YES";
           }
           else{
             return "NO";
